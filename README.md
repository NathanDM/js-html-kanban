# js-html-kanban
Proof Of Concept for the new kanban in HTML


## Local dependencies

install the local dependencies :

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Watch For Changes

```sh
$ npm start
```

This will perform an initial build and start a watcher process that will update bundle.js with any changes you wish to make.
This watcher is based on Browserify and Watchify, and it transforms React's JSX syntax into standard JavaScript with Reactify.

To run the app, spin up an HTTP server and visit http://localhost/... Or simply open the index.html file in a browser.
